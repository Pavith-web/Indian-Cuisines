    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >Telangana Cuisine is typically spicy and ingredients such as tamarind, sesame seeds, red chillies and asafoetida are widely used in a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Roselle is a staple item used in making curries and pickles. Sources state that while in Telangana, millet bread/roti is a staple diet its neighbouring state of Andhra prefers rice. Hyderabad is the shared capital of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and is obviously wildly popular for its biryanis and Karachi biscuits. But there is so much more to Telangana Food that many of us are completely unaware of.

It is a savoury pancake made of rice flour, chana dal, peanuts and chilli. It is cooked in a deep, round shaped pan and to preserve the sanctity of the recipe, it is pertinent to make holes in the rolled out dough mixture before cooking it.

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >HYDERABADI BIRYANI</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >Thanks to the major influence of Nizams in the state, Hyderabadi Biryani has come to be known worldwide as one of India’s jeweled food items. It is of two types; Kachchi gosht ki biryani and Pakki biryani. Marinated meat is cooked in layers of rice in a big handi which is covered with flat dough that eventually rises due to heat; indicating that the biryani is ready to be devoured.  With two different cooking methods producing mouthwatering results, the biryani has transformed over the years to satisfy everyone’s taste buds and it even has a vegetarian version.

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >SEKINALU</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >Who doesn’t love some crispy, deep-fried snack every now and then? Sakinalu is one of those grubs that Indians have been perfecting over the years in various parts of India and giving it different names like murkku, chakli etc. But Sakinalu is not the same as the aforementioned items although they do share a slightly similar preparation. Its two chief ingredients are rice and sesame seeds and is devoid of spices, therefore making it a mild snack that is also easy to prepare. It is mainly made during the festival of Sankranti or is offered during marriage.

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >PACHI PULUSU</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >A quick fix for that morning where you’re too sick to cook or you’re craving for Rasam but you are lazy to carry out the entire process of making; Pachi Pulusu will come to your rescue. So the basic difference between Pachi Pulusu and Rasam is that the former has very little “cooking” involved and uses the gas only to temper the seasoning. The commonality is their ingredients. While tamarind requires to be boiled for rasam, it only needs to be soaked in lukewarm water for this dish. The simplicity of the dish sure helps our lazy selves to have wholesome food once in while!</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >A tea-time accompaniment, Chegodilu is a crunchy snack item that is almost impossible to stop munching on after the first bite. Toasted sesame seeds are the special feature in this deep fried snack giving it a unique nutty flavor that goes well with the mild spiciness.</p>

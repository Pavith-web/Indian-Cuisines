    <!-- <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">ABOUT</h3> -->
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">From the world-famous pav bhaji to the delicious poha, Maharashtra Food has a lot to offer. Food of Mahrashtra of Maharashtrian cuisine can be broadly classified into two styles- Konkan and Varadi. Konkan being from the coastal region has influences from Goan, Saraswat, Gaud and Malvani regions. Varadi cuisine, on the other hand, belongs to the Vidarbha region. Some spices like Goda Masala, Kokum, Tamarind and Coconut are essential ingredients in the Maharashtrian kitchen. Maharashtrian cuisine is considered to be very diverse as the flavours and spice levels differ in different parts of the state.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">
        <li>Pav Bhaji</li>
        <li>Vada Pav</li>
        <li>Puran Poli</li>
        <li>Misal Pav</li>
        <li>Modak</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">PAV BHAJI</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Amchi Maharashtra food is incomplete without this dish which has come to be synonymous to the state! Fresh and thick slices of bread, smothered in butter served with a delicious mix of moderately spiced vegetables. This lip-smacking dish has won the heart of every Indian!</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">VADA PAV</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Vada Pav can easily be called the Indian version of a burger! A delicious, spicy, deep-fried patty made of potato is squeezed between a thick slice of bread, similar to a burger bun. Between the vada (patty) and pav (bread) a spicy mix of spices and salt is sprinkled and garnished with a fried, salted green chilli. Sounds perfect, isn't it? It's an all-day snack and is extremely popular among Maharashtrians. It is very economical, filling and easily accessible. Another popular offshoot is the Bhajiya Pav, which has batter-fried onions instead of the patty</p>

At times, it is eaten with yoghurt to lessen the spice. Although it is a breakfast food but Maharashtrians enjoy it at time of the day. There are various types of Misal such as Puneri Missal (topped with poha), Nagpuri Missal, Kolhapuri Missal and Mumbai Missal which are very spicy.</p>

This sweet is Ganpati's favourite and that is for a very definite reason for sure.</p>

    <!-- <h3 style="font-weight:bold">ABOUT</h3> -->
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Many of us associate Gujarat only with dhokla, khakhra or the
        drool-worthy Gujarati Thali. But there is more to the Food of Gujarat than that. North Gujarat, Kacch,
        Kathiyawad and Surti Gujarat are four major regions of Gujarat and each of these bring their own uniqueness to
        Gujarati cuisine.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">
        <li>Khaman</li>
        <li>Thepla</li>
        <li>Khandvi</li>
        <li>Undhiyu</li>
        <li>Muthiya</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold">KHAMAN</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">A tasty and healthy steamed snack made from freshly ground lentils
            and chickpea flour, it is very similar to its humble cousin, the world-famous -dhokla. To prepare the khaman,
            the khaman flour mix is boiled along with turmeric, salt and baking soda to make it light and fluffy. It is then
            cut up into cubes and usually garnished with mustard seeds, coriander leaves, sev and chopped onions.
            Traditionally served on a large green leaf called the Kesuda, the modern, urban version is served in newspapers
            in farsan (snack) shops with tangy chutneys and several pieces of green chillies. Popular adaptations of the
            khaman include Ameri khaman (mashed up khaman garnished with sev and pomegranate), Nylon khaman (softer and
            fast-cooking khaman) and Masala khaman (khaman served with hot and spicy chilly powder).</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold">THEPLA</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">No Gujarati journeys, picnics, foreign trips or even business trips
            are complete without this ubiquitous snack. Made from gram flour, whole wheat flour, fresh fenugreek leaves and
            spices, these flatbreads are healthy snacking options with a long shelf life. Usually served piping hot with
            fresh curd, pickles or chundo, they make wholesome meals. When accompanied by a cup of steaming hot tea, they
            also make a sumptuous breakfast or a great snack during the monsoon. Although the methi (fenugreek) ones are the
            most common, other varieties include palak (spinach), amaranth or muli (raddish) theplas-specially recommended
            for fussy eaters.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold">KHANDVI</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Thin layers of gram flour cooked with buttermilk and rolled up in
            mushy goodness, seasoned with sautéed sesame seeds and a few other spices, that's khandvi for you. The simple
            but aromatic garnishing of curry leaves, coriander, sautéed cumin, mustard and coconut makes it simply
            irresistible. Also called 'suralichya wadya' in Maharashtra, it is a popular snack among Gujaratis and
            Maharashtrians alike. Although loved by all, no one can deny that this dish is a little tricky to cook,
            especially getting the consistency of the batter right. Light on the stomach and pleasing on the tongue, khandvi
            can be a perfect breakfast item or a delectable evening snack.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold">UNDHIYU</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">The king of Gujarati dishes Undhiyu (and of course Uttarayan) is the
            reason why a Gujarati eagerly awaits winter. It derives its name from the Gujarati word undhu, meaning inverted,
            it is a classical Gujarati dish made in an inverted clay pot. It is a special winter delicacy made from the
            choicest of fresh produce readily available in winter. Common ingredients include eggplant, crunchy muthiyas
            (fried chickpea flour dumplings), potatoes, yam, green peas, bananas and beans, slow-cooked to perfection with
            buttermilk, coconut and spices. Undhiyu served with puris and shrikhand is a common occurrence during Gujarati
            weddings.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold">MUTHIYA</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Named after the action that is used to shape the dough, these
            fist-cakes make for a great breakfast or evening snack. To prepare these, a mixture of chickpea flour, bottle
            gourd and spices is prepared, steamed, pan-fried and seasoned. If you skip the pan-frying, it becomes a great
            meal for the health-conscious folks. Other varieties include usage of spinach, fenugreek, amaranth or even
            bitter gourd. Juicy and fluffy on the inside, golden and crispy on the outside, no one can ever say no to a
            bowlful of muta hiya. Best relished with a dash of mint-coriander chutney or ketchup, and a cup of steaming hot
            tea. Try this Gujarati dish to know what it is all about.</p>

    <!-- <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">ABOUT</h3 > -->
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">West Bengal is not just about machh bhaat and the sweets. It has a lot more to it and is a haven for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian foodies. Did you know that Bengali cuisine is the only one in the Indian subcontinent that has a proper multi-course structure, much similar to the style of modern French cuisine? Bengalis love their food and like to have it served course-wise, instead of all at once, as is typically done in most other Indian regional cuisines.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">
        <li>Luchi Alur Dom</li>
        <li>Keemar Doi Bora</li>
        <li>Kathi Rolls</li>
        <li>Jhal Muri</li>
        <li>Daab Chingri</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">LUCHI ALUR DOM</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Luchi alur dom is the preferred Bengali combination for a lazy Sunday brunch. The dish has Luchi that is similar to puris and is eaten with alur dum or aloo dom, that is a spicier and more tangy version of the dum aloo. To grab a plate of some delectable luchi-alur dom, head to Fairlie Road in Kolkata, that is a popular haunt of the lovers of Bengali street food in the city. The road has a number of stalls that sell everything from rice and dish curry to kachuris (stuffed luchis).</p>

    <img class="rounded float-end" src="images\28.2.jpg">
    <div style="display:flex;height: 300px;flex-direction: column;box-sizing: border-box;padding: 10px;  ">
        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">KEEMAR DOI BORA</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Lovers of non-vegetarian food and dahi bada will go gaga over this perfect marriage of minced meat and sweet and spicy curd. This is one of the less popular street foods of Bengal. It has a rich cultural connection with one of the most famous Bengalis in the world- Nobel Laureate Rabindra Nath Tagore and his family. The dish was an original invention of the Thakurbari as the Tagore family is popularly known, and was introduced to the world by Purnima Thakur, when she came into the possession of the Tagore family cookbook. To sample this beautiful dish, you can head to Bara Bazaar or Burrabazaar in Kolkata.</p>

    <img class="rounded float-start" src="images\28.3.jpg">
    <div style="display:flex;height: 300px;flex-direction: column;box-sizing: border-box;padding: 10px;  ">
        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">KATHI ROLLS</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;"> After all, they were invented in the City of Joy itself! Thin rotis wrapped around skewer-roasted succulent meat kebabs make for a beautiful dish that Bengalis take a lot of pride in. One school of thought credits the British of inventing the food, because they were too fastidious to touch the kebabs with bare hands. Whatever the origin, one must not deprive themselves of biting into the kathi rolls, the best which can be found at Nizam’s and Badshah in New Market, Kolkata. Another shop called Zaika in Park Street, Kolkata, also makes delectable kathi rolls.</p>

    <img class="rounded float-end" src="images\28.4.jpg">
    <div style="display:flex;height: 300px;flex-direction: column;box-sizing: border-box;padding: 10px;  ">
        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">JHAL MURI</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">You can call it the Bengali version of the bhel. Jhal Muri is another street food that Bengalis swear by. It’s made from rice flakes (muri) tossed with spicy chutney and mustard oil, along with roasted lentils and coconut chunks. It’s a convenient snack to munch on, while travelling around the city in the evening, and engaging in long-winding conversations with a friend. The absolute best place to sample the jhal muri is Dacre Lane or Dacre Street in Kolkata, that has been appreciated by the WHO that claimed that the food here was the Best Street Food in the World!</p>

    <img class="rounded float-start" src="images\28.5.jpg">
    <div style="display:flex;height: 300px;flex-direction: column;box-sizing: border-box;padding: 10px;  ">
        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">DAAB CHINGRI</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">There’s no denying the fact that the various kinds of fish curries of Bengali cuisine are the absolute best. But if you get fed up of eating fish and want to try some other meat here, you must sample the daab chingri- jumbo prawns cooked in mustard and served in tender coconut. Oh! Calcutta is one of the restaurants in Kolkata known for the best Daab Chingri. Other things to try out at this restaurant are the nolen-gurer ice-cream and the bhapa sondesh.</p>

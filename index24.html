        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >SAMBAR</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >This list has to begin with the mighty dish called Sambhar. It is a lentil-based stew which has been prepared with tomatoes and/or tamarind as its base for building flavours. Whether it is for breakfast or a lavish traditional Tamilian lunch spread, Sambar is a significant part of almost every meal in Tamil Nadu and in Tamilian homes everywhere. Vegetables such as carrots, yam, drumsticks and okra are added to the pot of Sambar to make it more delicious and nutritious.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >PULIYODORAI</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >Tamarind, coconut and rice are very common ingredients used in Tamil Brahmin food. One such dish that comes from combining tamarind and rice is Puliyodarai. It is a special dish and is generally made during festivals and special occasions. First, it is offered to God as prasadam while praying in the temple and then enjoyed by people. It is really easy to prepare this tangy delicious dish and is generally accompanied with fryums or papadams.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >PARUPPU PAYASAM</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >Care for something sweet? This traditional sweet dish is made with moong dal, jaggery, coconut milk, ghee and nuts - that’s it! During summer, Paruppu Payasam is commonly prepared since moong dal is cooling for the body. It’s not overly sweet and is made using jaggery so you can enjoy a bowlful of this traditional dessert without any guilt. It tastes better when still hot.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >POLLACHI NANDI FRY</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >This one is for the seafood lovers! Tamil Nadu is a coastal state and there are many cities who have the pleasure of feasting on some incredible seafood dishes. One such dish the Pollachi Nandu Fry. It is Crab Fry that is prepared using a special spice mix that goes really well with the naturally sweet flavour of the crab. Many seafood restaurants serving the South Indian cuisines include this dish on their menu but there is just something very magical in enjoying the dish in Tamil Nadu on a slightly cool day, standing at a stall and prepared by a street vendor who makes sure that the spice mix is perfect.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;" >RASAM</h3 >
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;" >Rasam is a tangy, peppery broth that has been tempered with typical spices like curry leaves and mustard seeds. These are used frequently in Tamil cooking and the rest of South India. It is very different from Sambar and can be enjoyed with rice or just on its own. Rasam tastes best when its steaming hot and can be eaten any time of the year. Depending on the season, you can experiment with different lentils and ingredients (can add meat or seafood into the mix too) and enjoy this yummy Tamilian dish!</p>

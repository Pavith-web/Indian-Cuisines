    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">The food of Nagaland is known for its variety and simplicity. Being one of the major states in the North Eastern part of India, it is an important tourist site for its beautiful scenery and most importantly food. Naga food is considered spicy due to their love for the most famous king chilly ( known as raja mircha in the North East). I am going to give you all a brief on the ingredients used to make these delicious dishes and a few names of dishes as well as some of the main ingredients that are used in Naga food.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Samathu</li>
        <li>Aikibeye</li>
        <li>Akini</li>
        <li>Boiled Vegetables</li>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">SAMATHU </h3>
       <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">When Axone is used in smoked pork it is made into a thick curry with the use of a chilli powder called Samanthu which is a vital part of the dish making it more gravy like and most importantly spicy. This dish is prepared mostly in Sema/Sumi houses in Nagaland and is their signature food which is loved by all the people of the tribe. The dish is then slow cooked to give it more flavour and more time to cook.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">AIKIBEYE </h3>
       <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Aikibeye is a dish that comprises of Mustard leaf and Colocasia roots. This dish is cooked with very little salt and no spices giving it a bland flavour making it perfect for being eaten with the flavorful and spicy Non- Veg dishes of Nagaland. Very little water is used as this is mostly preferred thick.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">AKINI </h3>
       <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Akini Chokibo, doesn’t the name say it all as described in the heading of course. So, this dish is basically made by roasting and grounding the Perilla seeds which are then cooked with paddy field snails. Other things added to the dish while it is being cooked is a little bit of lard from the pork and Axone.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">BOILED VEGETABLES </h3>
       <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">This is of course ‘THE’ dish of Nagaland. Whichever dish you might find yourself eating will always be accompanied by boiled vegetables like spinach, beans, carrots, Colocasia leaves etc.

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">FISH COOKED IN BAMBOO </h3>
       <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">One of the many ways that Naga people cook their food is by using Bamboo tubes. The fishes are filled inside the tube along with a little bit of spice and allowed to be smoked over a fire. Once, the fishes are cooked they are ready to be eaten. As you taste this dish you will feel a hint of bamboo flavour on your tongue, something different and tasty. </p>

    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Rajasthani food has been influenced by the dearth of vegetables and water in this arid state. The hunting expeditions of the rich and the lifestyle of local warriors has given rise to a whole range of innovative dishes and ingredients that can last for several days. The use of dried lentils, beans, milk and buttermilk is common in cooking. Oil and red chillies help preserve the food and reduces the need for water. Each region of Rajasthan has its own trademark dish.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Top varities of food in this state are:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">
        <li>Dal Bati Churma</li>
        <li>Gatte ki Subzi</li>
        <li>Laal Maans</li>
        <li>Ker Sangri</li>
        <li>Papad ki subzi</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">DAL BATI CHURMA</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">This is the state's classic signature dish. Baati is hard, unleavened bread cooked in the desert areas of Rajasthan. Baati is prized mainly for its long shelf life, plus it requires hardly any water for its preparation. It is always eaten with dal (lentil curry). The dal is made of lentils while churma is a coarsely ground wheat mixture crushed and cooked in ghee and jaggery or sugar</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">GATTE KI SUBZI</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">Most of Rajasthani cusine came to fruition as a result of the arid conditions. For this dish you don’t need any fresh vegetables and that’s its speciality. This curry is made with gram flour dumplings (steamed and lightly fried) and tangy gravy made up of tomato, buttermilk and spices. It’s best enjoyed with rotis (Indian flat bread) and rice. </p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">LAAL MAANS</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">In this predominantly vegetarian state, the most famous non-vegetarian dish is laal maans. Laal maans literally means ‘red meat’ and the dish got its name because of its red color. Traditionally, laal maans used to be made with wild boar or deer. Today, it consists of marinated spicy mutton curry cooked on a low heat in a fiery sauce of red chillies, garlic paste, sliced onions and curds. A must-try for meat eaters.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">KER SANGRI</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">One of the most popular Rajasthani dishes, ker is a wild berry that is tangy and peppery while sangri is a type of long bean grown abundantly in the desert areas of Jaisalmer and Barmer. Sangri is a mainstay during drought, when little else is available as it is 53% protein. Legend has it that long ago there was a famine in Rajasthan and the villagers found these two vegetables when all other vegetation had withered away. The villagers took these vegetables home and due to the scarcity of water cooked them in vegetable oil with spices. They ate this wonderful concoction with their bajra rotis. Today they cook it with buttermilk or water.</p>

        <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">PAPAD KI SUBZI</h3>
        <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: cursive;">The shortage of rain and water always made Rajasthanis think out of the box, and this dish was a lifesaver when they ran out of vegetables. In this popular curry, roasted papads (thin Indian flatbreads made from lentils) are broken roughly and added to the yogurt gravy made with gram flour, chilli powder, turmeric and chopped coriander leaves. The result is a mouth watering curry usually served with steamed rice.</p>
